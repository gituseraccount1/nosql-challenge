# nosqlalchemy-challenge

I have been contracted by editors of the "Eat Safe, Love" food magazine to look at the rating data to help thie jornalists and food critics decide what articles in the future they need to focus on. 

There are 3 sections to this challenge:
1. Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
2. Update the Database
3. Exploratory Analysis
